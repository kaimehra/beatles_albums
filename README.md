Can Spotify song characteristics cluster The Beatles’s songs into their albums as they released them? Are there clusters that better group similar songs together?
Hypothesis
The Beatles’s were known for being experimental and trying new things from album to album, and from my experience, I believe The Beatles’s albums are relatively cohesive. Thus, I think that the k-means clustering algorithm will be able to separate some of the albums apart. However, I do not think that the algorithm will be able to identify all 13 albums as there is overlap in style and sound between albums.
